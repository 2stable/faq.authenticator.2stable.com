## **What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?**

<br />

Two-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes referred to as two-step verification, is an extra layer of security for your account in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. This process is done to better protect both the user's credentials and the resources the user can access. 

<br />

Two-factor authentication provides a higher level of security than authentication methods that depend on single-factor authentication (SFA), in which the user provides only one factor -- typically, a password or passcode. Two-factor authentication methods rely on a user providing a password, as well as a second factor, usually either a security code or a biometric factor, such as a fingerprint or facial scan.
