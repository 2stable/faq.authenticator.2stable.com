## **How to cancel my trial or subscription?**

<br />

We’re sorry to see you go! App Store subscriptions renew automatically and need to be canceled manually. For a quick step-by-step, [**follow Apple’s guide here**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118428). 

<br />

If you’d like help from us directly, [**reach out to our support team**](authenticator://contact?subject=Cancel%20my%20subscription) - we’re here for you!
